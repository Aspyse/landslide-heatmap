# landslide-heatmap
Heatmap of landslides around the world. I created this project as a submission for our first quarter in the Computer Science 4 Elective. This was also entered in a showcase for the technology education in Philippine Science High School.
It takes a csv file of nasa data of global landslides, from which it creates a heatmap weighted by landslide size.
